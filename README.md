Habit Tracker - User Guide (Version 1.0)

📢 A Small Step Towards Big Change

Hi Friends,

Small habits compound over time and lead to unimaginable growth. However, acknowledging when we miss a habit is just as important as celebrating progress.

That’s why I created this Habit Tracker – a simple tool that doesn’t judge but helps you stay accountable in a private and motivating way.

🌟 How to Use the Habit Tracker?
1️⃣ Download & Setup
Download the executable file from Google Drive → [(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLbxDphtFiMAo9al16a7LaXdVbL7D7zZ2vXg8tkghb4/edit?usp=sharing)]

Save it in a folder of your choice.

First-time users may see an alert: "Database file is empty." → Ignore it (the tracker creates a new database automatically).

2️⃣ Daily Habit Tracking
Run habit_tracker.exe.

Check off completed habits for the day.

Click "Save Progress" before closing.

3️⃣ End-of-Day Reflection (Optional but Powerful!)

Spend 15-30 minutes before bed updating the tracker.

Write reflections in your notebook:

📖 What did you read today?

😊 What was a pleasant moment you cherished?

🎯 Any personal insights?

This small ritual can make a huge difference in self-improvement!

📊 Viewing Your Progress

Note : You shall get a warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning, which appears when Windows doesn't recognize an application. Since your Habit Tracker is an unsigned executable, Windows flags it as a potential risk.
